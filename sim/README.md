# SHEAR sim

MuJoCo sim of the SHEAR deleafing module. The plan and the research behind it are in the Vinea vault,
under `08 Modules/SHEAR/`.

## Setup

    ./fetch_so101.sh          once: the SO-101 model into sim/assets/so101 (gitignored)
    conda activate lerobot    it has mujoco

Every run goes under the 9 GB cap:
`systemd-run --user --scope -q -p MemoryMax=9G -p MemorySwapMax=0 python ...`

## Step 1: one stem, one leaf, the cut

    python check_cut.py --windowed     watch it: the jaw closes, the blades cut the petiole next to the stem,
                                       the leaf drops, and it starts over
    python check_cut.py                PASS/FAIL checks, a few seconds

On Wayland the window opens without a title bar. Close it with Ctrl+C in the terminal.

- `scene.py`: the SO-101 holds one pose (all joints at zero, the wrist rolled so the jaw hinge is level).
  The stock jaws collide through boxes, and each fingertip has a blade on its stem side. The plant is
  built around the blades.
- `plant.py`: the stem; the leaf (rigid petiole, a midrib that droops, leaflets), welded to the stem;
  and the `Cutter`. The cut happens only when both blade edges press the petiole hard enough for a full
  stroke. Then the leaf drops and the stub it leaves is measured from the stem surface.

The checks cover these cases:
- the leaf hangs
- the blades hold a stalk they can't cut
- a cut at 2 mm and at 8 mm leaves that stub
- the leaf falls clear and the jaw closes through
- the stem isn't touched
- no cut at 25 % torque, with only the pads squeezing, or with the jaw closing on air
- a 20 N pull doesn't tear the leaf off

They also print what matters for the real gripper: the blade force the stock SO-101 jaw reaches on a
7 mm petiole. That is a sim estimate from the 12 V servo's stall torque: about 17 N at 50 % torque, and
7.5 N once the stalled servo drops to 25 %. Both are upper bounds, because the real PSU sags under load.

All plant sizes and the cut force are guesses marked `unverified` in the code, until measured on real
plants.
